# IS-362-Project-2

 Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information included in the dataset. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears in the discussion item, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
- Read the information from your .CSV file into Python, and use pandas as needed to tidy and transform your data. [Most of your grade will be based on this step!]
- Perform the analysis requested in the discussion item.
- Your code should be in an Jupyter Notebook, posted to your GitHub repository, and
should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and
conclusions.
